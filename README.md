Overview

  The goal of this project was to investigate districts with year round schooling in the United States and see how they compared to school districts with traditional schedules in their area by looking at metrics such as graduation rate and cost.  Using data from the National Center for Educational Statistics, and the Program for International Student Assessment among others, I was able to conclude that year round schooling in the United States can cost the same or less than a traditional schedule, while at the same time having as good or better outcomes in terms of graduation rates and drop out rates.
